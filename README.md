# Batman
Batman The Movie, Amiga, 2 Disk Europe, Ocean

This repo will contain the result of my attempt to reverse engineer the 2 Disk version of Batman The Movie for the Amiga. It was one of the first games I played on my own Amiga 500.

Firstly, I will be reversing the boot loader and ripping the files from the disk. I intend to document as much of the code as I can along the way. 

2024-03-27 - I have ripped the raw files from both disks, need to upload to the repo.

2024-03-26 - Up to this point I have successfully ripped the game loader, documented it and modified it sufficently to get the game to boot without the copy protection kicking in. I've decoded and disassembled the Rob Northen protection and spent some time understanding how it works. I need to upload these files to this repo.
